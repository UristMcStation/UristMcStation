#ZeroBits told me to clean my changelogs, I'm cleaning it.

author: Crushtoe

delete-after: True

changes: 
  - maptweak: The derelict is no longer complete trash. There's actual rooms and plenty of loot to loot, too!
  - rscadd: Added random spawns for hostile mobs on the Derelict. Now the good loot has a guardian pike/carp/viscerator.
