 /*										*****New space to put all UristMcStation Clothing (clothing/suit and clothing/under. I may split them up anyways)*****

Please keep it tidy, by which I mean put comments describing the item before the entry. Icons go to 'icons/urist/items/clothes/clothes.dmi'
All UMcS clothing will now go here, to prevent unecessary .dm's. I mean, how much clothes do we need anyways... -Glloyd //haha, i got that one right.

Update 23/03/2014 - removed all the ports of BS12 clothing. So, naval stuff, swimsuits, detective gear, cap's jacket, HoP whimsy and storage webbing stuff.

Update 26/07/2014 - All generic clothing goes under obj/item/clothing/under/urist. All generic suits go under /obj/item/clothing/suit/urist*/
