	description = "The Terran Confederacy, commonly referred to as the Confederacy or the TC, is an oligarchic federal republic \
	with a government structure loosely based on that of the Republic of Venice, composed of numerous human planets spanning many systems. \
	Based in the Sol System with its capital on Mars, the Terran Confederacy governs the majority of human space. \
	Currently engaged in a civil war with the United Human Alliance, the TC also suffered greatly during the Galactic Crisis. \
	Indeed, the deal with the Unathi to join the allied human forces during the Galactic Crisis came at the price of numerous trade concessions, \
	and the removal of longstanding immigration restrictions on Unathi. There is growing resistance to these concessions, and it is one of the main causes \
	behind the breakaway of the United Human Alliance planets. As a response to the growing militancy and ongoing civil war, the TC government has become \
	increasingly repressive and dictatorial. Recent miners' uprisings, and protests surrounding the upcoming presidential elections have \
	only exacerbated this situation.\
	The Terran Confederacy is nominally ruled by a president, who are Constitutionally limited to one eight-year term. The Terran president is little more than a figurehead, \
	although strong-willed Terran Presidents have been able to use their veto power and their prominent position to significantly influence politics in the past. \
	The current president, Mark Jacobs, is not one of these presidents, and has largely bent to the will of the politically powerful Terran Navy throughout his term. \
	Underneath him is the Council of Ten, comprised of ten generals, admirals and colonial governors elected by the lower bodies. The real power is here, \
	and their purpose is to guide the general expansion of the Confederacy and to dictate military and political strategy. \
	Underneath the Council of Ten is the Grand Council. The Grand Council features representatives from each system controlled by the TC. \
	The Grand Council makes and passes laws, as well as advising the Council of Ten. Finally, at the bottom of the central government is \
	the Lower Council. This consists of representatives from every colony with over ten million people. \
	As is apparent, the Lower Council is quite big, and does not reside on Mars (unlike the other Councils) instead choosing to \
	communicate by Holomessage. The Lower Council's job is to vote on laws proposed by the Grand Council and to propose amendments to them. \
	The TC's population is diverse including many non-humans and encompassing a wide range of systems, territories \
	habitats, and celestial bodies. However, it is large, cumbersome, divided and slow to respond to issues due to \
	its massive bureaucracy and the distance between worlds. Nonetheless, the Terran Confederacy governs as one of the \
	most advanced and powerful civilisations in the known galaxy."

	It consists of a huge assortment of vessels of varying sizes broken up into a number of smaller \"Fleets\" each with their \

	The Fleet, being the large, sprawling organisation it is, is made up of thousands and thousands of men and women \
	(and more recently, a number of Sol IPC's) spread across a variety of duties, tasks and postings. \
	The oldest component of the Defence Forces, the Fleet considers itself the pinnacle of Human military accomplishment. \
	It is well funded, but seen as complacent and bloated. Until recently the Fleet have not had a serious enemy to deal with, \
	but is generally respected by the populace due to their work keeping away pirates, putting down insurrections, destroying \
	smugglers and taking potshots at the ocassional Vox. Currently undergoing major \

	description = "The United Human Alliance, commonly referred to as the UHA, is a growing power in human space,\
	bordered by the Terran Confederacy towards the galactic centre. Born out of the post Galactic Crisis unrest, \
	xenophobia and economic turmoil in the Terran Confederacy, the United Human Alliance is a radical xenophobic \
	secessionist movement started by a group of planetary governors and Terran politicians discontent at the \
	concessions made to the Unathi in exchange for their help during the Galactic Crisis. The UHA believes that the \
	war could have been won without the Unathi’s help, and blame the Unathi for the TC’s post-Galactic Crisis economic troubles. \
	A number of UHA leaders even advocate a conspiracy theory that the Unathi were behind the Galactic Crisis, a xenophobic sentiment \
	that likely stems from the apparent similarity between Lactera and Unathi. While the UHA has seen rapid initial gains in the civil war \
	with the Terran Confederacy	the damage done to their infrastructure and the poor economic state of the planets they hold has led to a \
	stalemate between the two sides. What is now called the 'Terran Civil War' has turned into a cold war of sorts, as both sides struggle to \
	amass the strength to deliver a decisive blow on the other. However, there are numerous UHA supporters across the Terran Confederacy, and there has \
	been an increasing amount of terrorist attacks and bombings by UHA supporters over the last few years, mostly targeting \
	Unathi and other alien races, along with Terran government locations. \
	The capital of the Alliance is the city of Ameranth on the planet of Terra (formerly known as New Earth) \
	in the Gilgamesh system. Externally heavily militant, extremely xenophobic and isolationist, the UHA, internally, is, in theory, heavily libertarian, with \
	a strong focus on independent planetary government with the UHA central government itself only handling defence, foreign relations and some intergalactic trade. \
	However, the central government and planetary governments are almost entirely dominated by the military, and civil rights have been extremely curtailed, in the name of winning the ongoing civil war."
