// This represents organized purely paramilitary organisations.
//
// Their primary interest is $MONEY$, but practically - whatever the client wants in exchange for it.
// This quirk means that they act as an armed face to another faction's interests.

// Archetypal interaction: Raided because you pissed off another faction
// Archetypal legit job: n/a
// Archetypal shady job: Subcontracting
