/*
// -*-  SLAPS  -*-
//
// This is a slightly tongue-in cheek name for a system designed to penalize ignoring Distortion.
//
// If a BSR player abuses their powers too much or does not care about Distortion effects, they
// will be faced with a straight-up negative and generally Unfun effect either targetting them
// SPECIFICALLY (as opposed to Distortions, which are just negative for everyone around), or
// a straight up round-ender - hence, we give them a Slap for not being an involved antag.
//
// The effect type is deliberately obfuscated from the BSR player to maintain the core focus of being a penalty;
// otherwise, some players might *deliberately* go for these, which is against the intended gameplay experience.
//
// Unlike normal Distortion Effects, which are triggered based on local 'pollution', Slaps are based off of
// the amount of *unsuppressed* Distortion - players can keep going even with insanely high Total Distortion
// for hours, but they MUST keep up with their Hungers to do so.
