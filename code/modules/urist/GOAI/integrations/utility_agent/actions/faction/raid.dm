/*
// A smash-and-grab operation. Get in, grab stuff, get out, attack anyone who objects.
//
// Uses a relatively light strike force (both in terms of number and equipment),
// 3 to 5-ish NPCs if targetting a player ship/station.
// Uses either a small, fast, dedicated 'speedboat'/sloop-of-war craft or an unassailably heavy warship
// (in which case this is a single squad tasked with the operation).
//
// Either way, the solution is to either eliminate all the raiders, or wait.
// They will eventually pull back on their own - stealing whatever they can held on to.
//
// A perennial favourite of pirates and gangs, although bigger players may also use this
// tactic to harrass and deny their enemies their assets or as a form of revenge.
