HEALTH_THRESHOLD_DEAD -100

## Determines whether bones can be broken through excessive damage to the organ

BONES_CAN_BREAK 1

## Determines whether limbs can be amputated through excessive damage to the organ
## 0 means limbs can't be amputated, 1 means they can
LIMBS_CAN_BREAK 1

## multiplier which enables organs to take more damage before bones breaking or limbs being destroyed
## 100 means normal, 50 means half
ORGAN_HEALTH_MULTIPLIER 100

## multiplier which influences how fast organs regenerate naturally
## 100 means normal, 50 means half
ORGAN_REGENERATION_MULTIPLIER 75

## multiplier which effects how much organ damage spillover is added to mob shock_stage (default 0.5)
#ORGAN_DAMAGE_SPILLOVER_MULTIPLIER 0.5

## Uncomment to make organs decay if they're not inside a freezer
ORGANS_CAN_DECAY

### REVIVAL ###

## whether pod plants work or not

## whether cloning tubes work or not
REVIVAL_CLONING 1

## amount of time (in hundredths of seconds) for which a brain retains the "spark of life" after the person's death (set to -1 for infinite)
REVIVAL_BRAIN_LIFE -1



### MOB MOVEMENT ###

## We suggest editing these variabled in-game to find a good speed for your server. To do this you must be a high level admin. Open the 'debug' tab ingame. Select "Debug Controller" and then, in the popup, select "Configuration". These variables should have the same name.

## These values get directly added to values and totals in-game. To speed things up make the number negative, to slow things down, make the number positive.


## These modify the run/walk speed of all mobs before the mob-specific modifiers are applied. 
RUN_SPEED 1
WALK_SPEED 4


## The variables below affect the movement of specific mob types.
HUMAN_DELAY 0
ROBOT_DELAY 0
MONKEY_DELAY 0
ALIEN_DELAY 0
METROID_DELAY 0
ANIMAL_DELAY 0
SLIME_DELAY 0


### MISC ###

## Max amount of mushrooms where spores will no longer spread (Default 15)
#MAXIMUM_MUSHROOMS 15

## Uncomment to allow loyalty implants
#USE_LOYALTY_IMPLANTS

### URIST STUFF ###

## Uncomment to enable FoV cones (globally; you can force it on for individuals with VV)
#ENABLE_FOV_CONES

## Personal Distortion growth per tick
BLUESPACE_REVENANT_DISTORTION_RATE 100

## Decisecond delay between BSR ticks
BLUESPACE_REVENANT_TICKRATE 50

# Should Distortion spread across adjacent station z-levels
BLUESPACE_REVENANT_RADIUS_ZLEVEL_SPREAD_ENABLED 1

## Probability of triggering a BSR Distortion effect for a tile depends on the current level of 'irradiation'.
## This represents the turf-level Distortion that corresponds to 50% of max_chance_per_turf of triggering.
BLUESPACE_REVENANT_DISTORTION_MAXCHANCE_HALFWAY_POINT 500

## Cutoff max probability value for applying a BSR Distortion effect on an affected turf
BLUESPACE_REVENANT_DISTORTION_MAX_CHANCE_PER_TURF 8

## Amount of Distortion accumulated to trigger the first radius increase (1 -> 3 tiles across)
BLUESPACE_REVENANT_RADIUS_THREE_DISTORTION_THRESHOLD 12000

## Amount of Distortion accumulated to trigger the second radius increase (3 -> 5 tiles across)
BLUESPACE_REVENANT_RADIUS_FIVE_DISTORTION_THRESHOLD 36000

## Amount of Distortion accumulated to trigger the third radius increase (5 -> 7 tiles across)
BLUESPACE_REVENANT_RADIUS_SEVEN_DISTORTION_THRESHOLD 98000

## Can Distortion spread across adjacent station z-levels? NOTE: more CPU-heavy!
BLUESPACE_REVENANT_RADIUS_ZLEVEL_SPREAD_ENABLED 1

## For Equivalent Exchange Hunger: how much does suppression grow per unit of wealth consumed?
BLUESPACE_REVENANT_WEALTHEATER_SUPPRESSION_FACTOR 1

## For Catabolic Stabilization Hunger: how much does suppression grow per unit of nutrition consumed?
BLUESPACE_REVENANT_HONGRY_SUPPRESSION_FACTOR 30

## For Rune Wards Hunger: how much does suppression grow per rune, in fractions of normal growth/decisecond
BLUESPACE_REVENANT_RUNEWARDS_SUPPRESSION_PER_WARD_FACTOR 0.2

## For Rune Wards Hunger: discourages stockpiling/spamming; no more than this much suppression per tick will happen, so more runes is not necessarily more good
BLUESPACE_REVENANT_RUNEWARDS_MAX_SUPPRESSION_COEFF 2

## For Bloodburner Hunger: how much does suppression grow per unit of blood/brute burned?
BLUESPACE_REVENANT_BLOODBURNER_SUPPRESSION_FACTOR 3000

## For Bloodthirsty Hunger: how much does suppression grow per sip of blood consumed?
BLUESPACE_REVENANT_BLOODTHIRSTY_SUPPRESSION_FACTOR 600
