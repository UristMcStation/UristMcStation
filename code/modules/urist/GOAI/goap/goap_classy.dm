  This is an implementation of the GOAP AI algorithm for DM.

  GOAP is a search-based planning algorithm that promises AIs
  that are smart, organic, modular, easily extensible (i.e.
  adding new behaviors is a breeze) and still fairly 'cheap'.

  TL;DR, we know how to pathfind gud and fast since the 60s;
  if you zoom your brain out, planning a path is just a sequence
  of steps - and so is planning *actions*. So, we can yoink some
  good pathfinding algorithms (A*) and use them for AI planning.

  This *works*, and there's a good chance you played something
  that uses this AI architecture, especially around 2010 - notably,
  F.E.A.R., TES: IV & V (although Radiant AI is a fairly cut-down
  version) or Deus Ex: Human Revolution, just to name the AAA titles.

  This is a fairly ambitious implementation; unlike classic GOAP
  as originally described by Jeff Orkin, we're (ab-)using assoc
  lists and proc dynamic dispatch to be much more flexible.

  =*=   FLEXIBILITY   =*=

  Notably, by default our states can be described not just as
  booleans (True/False), but as numeric values (or even strings or
  lists, if your custom logic can handle that).

  This means that we can create plans that track resource (e.g. money,
  energy, health) usage  smartly without creating a billion boolean
  flags for each variant and to account for their depletion when
  scoring each plan.

  This also allows for goals that are more elaborate; e.g. 'be at
  position (15, 30) while having at least 20$ and full health'.

  That said, use this sparingly - the more complex the goal, the
  more expensive the plan will be to compute.

  =*=    EFFICIENCY    =*=

  This brings us to another trick: this implementation has been
  designed to be portable and easily paused/resumed/stopped and
  support hard limits on resource consumption.

  Thanks to DM's sleep(), this algorithm runs fairly seamlessly
  in the background even for heavy jobs.

  We don't want to choke the server with unsatisfiable jobs though;
  you can set a hard limit on the number of iterations before the
  planner gives up - in that case, we simply get a null back.

  You can also limit the max queue size, to prevent bigger jobs
  from eating up all the RAM. This may even speed up the search
  sometimes!

  =*=      SETUP      =*=

  An unfortunate side-effect of trying to support ALL use-cases
  is that it's hard to support any specific one out of the box.

  GOAI takes in a *lot* of parameters, and you will likely need
  to define a bunch of procs to tailor it to your use-cases.

  Worse yet, as DM doesn't, to my knowledge, support closures,
  it's hard to provide generic procs that would work on simple
  customized variants of my preferred graph structure.

  At minimum, you will need to define:
  (1) at least one Action Graph
  (2) a proc to fetch Preconditions for each Action in the Graph as an assoc list
  (3) a proc to fetch Effects for each Action in the Graph as an assoc list
  (4) a proc that compares two assoc lists, Current & Preconds and returns 1 if
  the Current state meets the requirements of the Action, 0 otherwise.
  (5) a proc that compares two assoc lists, Current & Goal and returns 1 if
  the Current state meets the requirements of the Goal, 0 otherwise.

  You can see a sample setup in the goap_testing.dm file.
