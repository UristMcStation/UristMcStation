	NanoTrasen is currently headquartered in New Amsterdam on Procyon and headed by CEO Jackson Trasen and the NanoTrasen Board of Directors. \
	It deals in research of the most advanced sciences,	such as genetics, blue space, and - recently - the uses of phoron, \
	as well as mass consumer manufacturing on a truly galactic scale. Since the Galactic Crisis, they have increasingly turned to contracting independent vessels \
	to conduct their work in the outer systems. As such, as such, NanoTrasen is frequently the only human presence remaining in outer systems, lending them a virtual monopoly on trade in these areas."

	Based in the Sol System with its capital on Mars, the Terran Confederacy governs the majority of human space. However, between the ongoing Terran Civil War with the United Human Alliance, \
	growing rebellions for liberation in the outer colonies, and the lasting impact of the Galactic Crisis, the Terran Confederacy has been rapidly declining in recent years, and some fear its imminent collapse."

	xenophobia and economic turmoil in the Terran Confederacy, the United Human Alliance is a radical xenophobic \
	secessionist movement started by a group of planetary governors and Terran politicians discontent at the \
	concessions made to the Unathi in exchange for their help during the Galactic Crisis. Based out of the planet of Terra (formerly known as New Earth), \
	the central government and planetary governments are almost entirely dominated by the military, and civil rights have been extremely curtailed, in the name of winning the ongoing civil war."

	better armed, and more numerous. A large number of this growth comes from those displaced by the Galactic Crisis, who have turned to piracy as a means of survival when the state has failed them. \

	with the other constituent species of the invading force. With the alien forces broken after the Battle of Qerrbalak in 2565, the Galactic Crisis has ended. However, although the  \
