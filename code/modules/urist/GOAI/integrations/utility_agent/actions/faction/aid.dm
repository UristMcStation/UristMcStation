// While factions are largely amoral, self-interested agents, altruism has its benefits.
//
// Whether its buying influence from the target or using them to fight a proxy war, a faction
// may find it advantageous to provide resources to another faction without explicit quid-pro-quo.
//
// This bolsters the target faction and provides a substantial bonus to the target's
// relationship towards the supplier at the cost of the resources being transferred.
//
// Note that this can represent anything from purely humanitarian aid to giving an extremist group
// a spare nuclear warhead you stumbled upon in one of your warehouses the other day.
