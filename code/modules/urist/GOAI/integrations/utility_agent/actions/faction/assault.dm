/*
// When you absolutely, positively want someone out of your turf.
//
// An operation with the aim of either destroying enemy forces or forcing their withdrawal from the area.
//
// In the context of spess, this represents a 'marine' strike, as opposed to bombarding the target to shreds, so
// it's a somewhat gentler form of mass murder - leaves the structures mostly intact!
//
// This attack would generally involve a larger force with heavier kit (if possible for the faction).
// Ship-wise, either a group of small raid ships or a single 'medium', corvette/frigate-ish, craft.
//
// Unlike a raid, the attackers will NOT eventually go away on their own by default.
// The solution is to either fight off the strike force or get the hell out of the area.
// In the latter case, they will generally hang around a while to make sure you are gone.

// There's a LOD-like thing that could be going on here.
// For remote state, this should be a pure simulation.
// When players are near, this should turn into actual spawners.
