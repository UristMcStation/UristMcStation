	/* NOTE RE: chunk size
	//
	// For Geometry(TM) reasons, not all sizes are equally nice.
	//
	// Odd-sized chunks are easier to reason about, since they have
	//   a non-abstract centre tile, the smallest unit being 3x3.
	//
	// Then we might want to decompose things hierarchically.
	//
	// The general series formula is that for a valid size S,
	//   the next smallest aggregate of 4xS units is (2S-1),
	//   followed by (4S-3) and ((2n)S - (2n-1)) in general,
	//   assuming the default overlap of 1 tile.
	//
	// As a shortcut, here's the first couple good options:
	// => 3,
	// => 5 (= 4x3),
	// => 9 (= 4x5 = 16x3),
	// => 17 (= 4x9 = 16x5 = 64x3)
	//
	// 13 is decomposable, but to 7x7 units which are themselves not nice.
	//
	// 17 is *huge* - basically a screen's worth of tiles - so it's not very
	//    fine-grained; probably on overkill and better handled by a bunch of
	//    smaller moves and replanning after the move, unless you use PRA* or
	//    something similar.
	//
	//    Probably the upper useful bound for SS13, since the next candidate
	//    that is decomposable quite as nicely is *thirty-honking-three*.
