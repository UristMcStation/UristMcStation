// A more subtle, if no less violent, breed of lawbreaker compared to raiders,
// these factions subvert other societies' institutions for their collective gain *covertly*.
//
// This represents (semi-)organised crime such as gangs. mafia families, smuggling or drug operations,
// or degenerate forms of political groups, such as revolutionaries, former regime personnel - or for that
// matter, rogue black operations of otherwise legitimate intelligence organisations - whose operatives have
// left their original ideologies behind in favor of accumulating personal wealth and power.
//
// Their primary interest is $MONEY$.
// Their main tool is skulduggery, followed by direct action and economic pressure
// (by necessity, not choice - they lack the legitimacy to have much legitimate muscle, and the shady influence is
// covered by skulduggery already).
//
// Archetypal interaction: Trade (black market)/Shady job offer
// Archetypal legit job: 'The boss says: you lot wouldn't mind taking this innocuous crate of perfectly legal substances to that station there, eh?'
// Archetypal shady job: 'Our Human Resources department needs help with a transport.'
