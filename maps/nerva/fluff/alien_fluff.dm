	description = "Similar in appearance to the Unathi, the Lactera are one of the constituent races of the invading alien forces of the Galactic Crisis. Formerly mind-slaved to the powerful Allophylus, \
	the Lactera were the frontline soldiers of the invaders. Although at one point they were a distinct species with their own culture and free will, psionic enslavement by the Allophylus has changed that. \
	Born in a laboratory and raised for the sole purpose of killing, they are creatures genetically modified to be an ideal soldier. \
	Without fear, or regard for their own lives, they are extremely dangerous, despite being relatively fragile. \
	Indeed, they do not feel pain, they do not need to breathe, and their feet are implanted with a magnetic traction system. Driven only by a desire to kill, they can psionically \
	communicate with the other members of their hivemind in order to work effectively as a unit. \
	With the psionic control of the Allophylus broken after the Battle of Qerrbalak in 2565, the Lactera are directionless and scattered. \
	Individual units of Lactera have turned to piracy and raiding - killing is the only thing they know, and they continue to do so aimlessly, although \
	with ruthless efficiency they became known for during the Galactic Crisis."

	with the other constituent species of the invading force. With the alien forces broken after the Battle of Qerrbalak in 2565, the Galactic Crisis has ended. However, although the  \
