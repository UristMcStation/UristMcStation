--Okay, they implemented this on BS12, and I dislike how they did it. The top is green, and shoots a green pulse. It also has different values then the one I coded.
The point is that theirs is closer to the X-COM plasma pistol, despite the fact that all depictions of plasma in SS13 are purple, thus my choice to edit
the sprite and make my own projectile -Glloyd*/
