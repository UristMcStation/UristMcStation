	The second and final celestial body to ever be terraformed by humans, the terraforming of Venus was less effective than that of Mars, \
	leading to the development of large trading colonies based around the poles due to the excessive heat elsewhere on the planet. Owned by the Terran Confederacy, \
	Venus has fallen by the wayside in recent centuries as humanity has looked outwards rather than expand in the Sol system. \
	Venus is humanity's innermost holding in the solar system, and is mostly populated by traders and extremely wealthy Terran citizens living in luxury aerostats. \
	Though normally thought of as an 'inhospitable hellhole', the aerostat habitats floating 50 kilometers above the Venusian surface are almost normal. \
	Venus' population of just under 800,000 is mainly housed in six floating cities near the northern pole. These cities are home to numerous casinos and smugglers' \
	dens, lending Venus a bit of a seedy reputation. Before the fall of the Sol Alliance, Venus was selected as the second terraforming candidate in the solar system. \
	However, although the surface would never be livable (the crushing pressure alone would take thousands of years to reverse), fifty kilometers up, \
	Terran air floated at a fairly cool altitude, and life could be sustained. The first aerostat, Selenia, was established in the latter half of the 22st century; \
	the other five followed shortly thereafter. The terraforming projects intended to make the atmosphere breathable never came to pass, but the aerostats remain.\
	The aerostats' need for buoyancy makes open air a necessity. As a result, high ceilings and wide-open areas abound within. \
