/*
// Pirates, outcasts, deserters and warlords. All-purpose enemies at the gates of civilization.
//
// Mind you - that's *on average*. All factions are, in one way or another, rational beings, not a horde of locusts.
// Their brutal methods may make them useful allies as much as it makes them a painful nuisance most of the time,
// and all the rest being equal - they prefer the easy money to risking their necks.
//
// Their core operations are racketeering and raiding, in that order of preference,
// though they may occasionally run similar jobs as Criminal factions on the side.
//
// Their main tool is direct action (or threat thereof).
//
// Archetypal interaction: Extortion/Boarders (depending whether the crew accepts)
// Archetypal legit job: n/a
// Archetypal shady job: 'We need 5 laser guns, will pay twice the going rate.'
