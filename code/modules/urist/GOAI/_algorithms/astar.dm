/*

AStar implementation shamelessly stolen from SS13 source.

This has diverged from the original SS13 AStar slightly,
so for time being this is going to be a semi-duplicate.

Not really relevant to the GOAP algorithm, which uses my own custom AStar
implementation; I just needed something better than the DM builtins for the
demo agent pathfinds and couldn't be bothered to reimplement the algorithm
just for *that*.

This implementation is more specialized towards atoms; the GOAP AStar is more
generic, working on datums and whatever else you massage into a tuple.

/*
A Star pathfinding algorithm
Returns a list of tiles forming a path from A to B, taking dense objects as well as walls, and the orientation of
windows along the route into account.
Use:
your_list = AStar(start location, end location, adjacent turf proc, distance proc)
For the adjacent turf proc i wrote:
/turf/proc/AdjacentTurfs
And for the distance one i wrote:
/turf/proc/Distance
So an example use might be:

src.path_list = AStar(src.loc, target.loc, /proc/fAdjacentTurfs, /proc/fDistance)

Note: The path is returned starting at the END node, so i wrote reverselist to reverse it for ease of use.

src.path_list = reverselist(src.pathlist)

Then to start on the path, all you need to do it:
Step_to(src, src.path_list[1])
src.path_list -= src.path_list[1] or equivilent to remove that node from the list.

Optional extras to add on (in order):
MaxNodes: The maximum number of nodes the returned path can be (0 = infinite)
Maxnodedepth: The maximum number of nodes to search (default: 30, 0 = infinite)
Mintargetdist: Minimum distance to the target before path returns, could be used to get
near a target, but not right to it - for an AI mob with a gun, for example.
Minnodedist: Minimum number of nodes to return in the path, could be used to give a path a minimum
length to avoid portals or something i guess?? Not that they're counted right now but w/e.

// Also added 'exclude' turf to avoid travelling over; defaults to null
